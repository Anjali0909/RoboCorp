# Solution Design for RobotSpareBin Bot

## Abstract Architectural Model
### Components:
1. **Input Module**:
   - Dynamically fetch configuration and input data.
   - Securely retrieve credentials.

2. **Processing Module**:
   - Processes each item using state transition logic.
   - Implements business logic to handle tasks.

3. **Exception Handling Module**:
   - Separates expected (business) exceptions from unexpected (system) exceptions.
   - Logs errors and provides retry mechanisms.

4. **Logging and Monitoring Module**:
   - Tracks every step of the bot for debugging and reporting.

5. **Output/Report Generation Module**:
   - Outputs results and generates a processing summary.

### State Transition Model:
Similar to UiPath ReFramework:
- **Init**: Set up configurations, credentials, and logging.
- **Process**: Process each item sequentially.
- **End**: Wrap up and generate reports.

## Justifications
- **Modular Design** improves reusability and maintainability.
- **State Transitions** provide a clear workflow for handling items.
- **Dynamic Credential Management** ensures secure operations.
- **Exception Handling** maintains process stability.
